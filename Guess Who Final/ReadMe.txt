IMPORTANT! 
May need to change the LIBS += path for the mysql driver location in the GuessWho-GUI.pro file. 
I'm using the pathway specified in the Plugin link from blackboard C:\MySQL\MySQL51\lib\opt.


The CreateTextFile.exe, although included may not run or be recognized by the program.
I tried using a .exe created from my PC on build from the computer lab and it would not run, although I think they use Visual Studio as their compiler so that may be the issue there.
In the case that it doesn't run or is not recognized by the program simply just Compile/Run the CreateText project and drop the .exe into the GuessWho-GUI's debug folder once its compiled.
